# Asynchronous-task
Develop an application to demonstrate the use of Asynchronous tasks in android. 

The asynchronous task should implement the functionality of a simple moving banner. 

On pressing the Start Task button, the banner message should scrollfrom right to left. 

On pressing the Stop Task button, the banner message should stop.

Let the banner message be “Demonstration of Asynchronous Task”.
